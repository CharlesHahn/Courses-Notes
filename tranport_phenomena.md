#### Syllabus

four unit tests, two in Autumn

#### Grading

Unit Exams = 10% * 4; Assignments = 20%; Final Exam = 40%;

Assignments：
- Each assignment has bEen listed on the course syllabus.
- Assignments are due within a week after each lecture (before each Tuesday).
- Should be written in English.

Unless you have an acceptable excuse, there will be a penalty on late assignments.
- if late, the grade will be reduced.

Write assignments by hand.

#### what are transport phenomena

- fluid Mechanics / momentum transport
    + conservation of momentum, fluid statics and <++>
- heat transport 
    + conservation of energy / energy transport
- mass transport 
    + mass balence of various chemical species / mass transport

#### why do we need to study these topics

- biotechnology
- microelectronics
- nanotechnology
- polymer science

#### why study them together

- often occur together (in above processes)
- mechanisms of transport are similar, based on molecular movements and interactions
- basic equations are similar, solving three transport problems "by analogy"
- similar mathematic tools for solving three transport problems

#### three levels of transport

- macroscope level (equipment level)
- microscope level (molecule < scale equipment)
- molecular level
    + seek a fundamental understand of the mechanisms of transport

#### contents of the course

- Part 1. preparative knowledge
- Part 2. fundamental concepts & simple illustrations
- part 3. foundation of transport phenomena
- Part 4. typical solutions in transport phenomena
- Part 5. selected topics in transport phenomena

## lecture one on 200915

**Part 1. preparative knowledge: vectors and tensors in cartesian coordinates (I)**

### concept of vectors

the concept of vectors came from the physical quantities which posses two characteristics: **magnitude** & **direction**.

#### Dot product of two vectors

<++>

#### cross product of two vectors

<++>

#### a vectors can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates

<++>

#### summary of algebraic operations

<++>


## Lecture 2. Vectors and Tensors in Cartesian Coordinates

#### review

$$(\delta_i · \delta_j) = 0 if cos(i, j) = 90$$

$$(\delta_i \times \delta_j) = \sum_{k=1} ...$$

$$hhhhh_$$ 

#### cnocept of Tensors

Teh concept of tensors came from the physical quantities with characteristics connected to more than **one direction**.

#### Dyadic Product & Dyads

- the dyadic product of two vectors **a** and **b**, donoted as **ab**, forms a 2nd-order tensor.

$$ab = ab^t$$

#### unit dyads

with the help of unit dyads, the dyadic product of two vectors can be defined analytically as:
$$_vw_ = \sum_{i} v_{i}\sigma_{i}$$ 

<++>

#### second-order tensors


#### matrix notation of second-order tensors


#### special second-order tensors 

the **unit tensor** is defined as 
$$\delta = \sum_{i}\sum_{j}\delta_{ij}...$$ 

<++>

<++>

<++>

#### decomposition theorem

<++>

#### algebraic operations of tensors

<++>

: first . inside two unit tensor, then outside two unit tensors


#### summation by dummy indices

<++>

the two indices alike are called <++>

#### transformation rules ot <++>
