### 1.2 kinetics of single substrate reactions

- A typical time course of single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions.
- initial reaction rate versus substate concentration
- at low [S]: v 正比于 [S], 1st order kenetics
- at high [S]: v 近似于constant, 0 order kinetics

#### 1.2.1 Michaelis-Menten Equation

- "rapid equilibrium assumption"
    + the enzyme and substrate first conbine to give an enzyme-substrate complex.
    + this complex then undergoes a chemical reaction
    + the first step was assumed to be a *rapid reversible* reaction
    + 单底物酶催化不可逆
    + [S] >> [E] !

#### 1.2.2 Briggs-Haldane Equation

- "quasi-steady state assumption"
    + the intermediate enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is at steady state
    + 均相反应（底物的摩尔浓度远大于酶）
    + 底物的摩尔浓度远大于酶浓度
    + 酶不失活

#### the michaelis constant (Km), the turnover number(kcat) and the ratio kcat/Km

- the michaelis contant(Km)
    + she physical meaning of Km : the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half of the maxium 
    + Km == S, V = Vmax /2 
    + Km 越小，酶和底物亲和力越强
- kcat翻转数，酶活性中心活性
    + kcat = Vmax / [E0], 单位时间里单位反应中心可将多少摩尔底物转化为产物, 简单米氏方程中，kcat = k2
    + for a series of intermediates, EP_i_ -> ki -> EP_{i+1}, 1/kcat = 1/k1 + 1/k2 + 1/k3 ..... 1/k(n-1)
- 专一性常数 kcat/Km 
    - 当[S]<< Km, v=(kcat/Km)[E0][S], in this case, [E0] 约等于[E], 必须大量游离酶存在，v=（kcat/Km)[E][S]
    - under these conditions, (kcat/Km) represent an effective 2nd order rate conttant for the combination of free substrate and free enzyme, and dhus provided an indication of the specificity of the enzyme for the substrate. 
    - it can be used to describe the specificity of the enzyme for competing substrates.
    - the ratio of the reaction rates for low concentration of two competing substrates (A and B) is given by:
    $$\frac{v_A}{v_B} = \frac{(k_{cat}/K_M)_A [A] }{ (k_{cat}/K_M)_B [B]$$ 

### 1.3 graphical representation of kenetic data

- lineweaver-burk plot
    + 直观、less accurate
    + 横截距(-1/Km) 纵截距(1/Vmax)
    $$\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{v_{max}} + \frac{K_M}{v_{max}} \frac{1}{[S]}$$ 
- eadie-hofstee plot
    + accurate for both parameters
    + 让反应速率等间隔，很难设计实验
    + slope = K_M, 横截距 = v_max/K_M
    $$v = v_{max} - \frac{K_M v}{[S]}$$ 
- hanes plot
    + 实验设计简单
    + accurate for v_max, less accurate for K_M
    + slope = 1/v_max, 纵截距 = K_M/v_max
    $$\frac{[S]}{v} = \frac{[S]}{v_{max}} + \frac{K_M}{v_{max}}$$ 

### 1.4 催化原理

- fundamentals - two approaches from classical chemical reaction kinetics.
    + collision
    + transition state theory

- collision theory
    + basic assumption: collision of molecules results in reaction. for a bimolecular reaction in the gas or liquid phase, the rate of reaction can be written as : 
    + $$v = k^{coll} [A][B]$$ 
    + the bimolecular rate constant k^coll can be describe as :
    + $$k^{coll} = Zpe^(- \frac{E_{act}}{RT})$$ 
    + where Z is the frequency of collision. p is fraction of molecules which have the correct orientation for reaction. E_act is the activation energy.
    + when p = 1 and E_act = 0: $k^{coll} = Z$. in this care the reaction is diffusion-limited.
    + the collision frequency Z can be described as the function of diffusion coefficients and radii of the reaction species
    + $$Z = \frac{4\pi N_{Avo}(D_A + D_B)(r_A + r_B)}{1000}$$ 
    + by stokes-einstein equation, the relationship between D and r is:
    + $$D = \frac{k_B T}{6\pi \eta r}$$ 
    + where k_B is the boltzmann constant and \eta is the fluid viscocity. so Z can be written as 
    + $$Z = \frac{2RT}{3000\eta}\left(\frac{(r_A + r_B)^2}{r_A r_B}\right)$$ 
    + where R is the gas constant (R = N_Avo k_B)
    + most enzyme reaction rates are in the range of 10^6 per sec per mol/L to 10^9 per sec per mol/L, so the collision theory only established the upper limit of reaction rates, while it does not provide any detailed information of chemical reaction.

- transition state theory
    + based on the collision theory, the transition state theory arrume further that colliding molecules must have sufficient energy to overcome a potential energy barrier to react.
    + this potential energy barrier is called **the energy of activation**.
    + by classical transition state theory, the reaction rate constant can be expresset as 
    + $$k = \left(\frac{k_B T}{h}\right)K^\pm$$ 
    + where k_B is the boltzmann constant, h is planck's constant and k^\pm is the concentration quilibrium constant; for enzyme reaction, k^\pm is defined as $k^\pm = (\frac{[ES]}{[E][S]})^\pm$, so k is in units of 1 per mol/L per s.
    + the standard Gibbs free energy of activation, \Delta G^\pm is defined as $\Delta G^\pm = - RTln(K^\pm c^0)$, $K^\pm = (c^0)^(-1) e^((-\Delta G^\pm)/RT) $ 
    + where c^\pm is standard state concentration.
    + setting c^\pm equal to unit concentration, k will be $ k = \left(\frac{k_B T}{h} K^\pm = \frac{k_B T}{h} e^{-\Delta G^\pm /RT}$ 
    + the Gibbs energy difference between the ground and the transition state thus can be used to predict the rate of reaction.
    + the Gibbs free energy of activation energy can be considered as composed of two terms $\Delta G^\pm = \Delta G^\pm_T + \Delta G_S$. where \Delta G_S is the binding energy involved in the form of (ES) from E and S, and \Delta G^\pm_T is the activation energy involved in the transfer of (ES) to (ES^\pm).
    + so the relationship between reaction rate constant and binding and activation energy can be written as $RTlnk = RT ln(\frac{k_B T}{h}) - \Delta G^\pm_T - \Delta G_S$
    + written the reactrate constant k as a second order constant (kcat / K_M). the above eq. change to $RTln(\frac{k_{cat}}{K_M}) = RT ln(\frac{k_B T}{h} - \Delta G^\pm_T - \Delta G_S$
    + if the enzyme conformation is more complementary to substrate, \Delta G_S arise, K_M drop, affinity between S and E arise.
    + if the enzyme conformation is more complementary to the transition state: binding energy \Delta G_S drop, and K_M arise, affinity between S and E drop. but the same time , the activation energy \Delta G^\pm_T decrease. thus it will benefit the reaction rate.
    + the intrinsic energy ensures the favorable formation of the ES complex, but if uncompensates, it makes the activation energy for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction unnecessarilly large and wastes sme of the catalytic power of the enzyme.

- Loss of Entropy
    + the role of Entropy in catalysis Entropy is composed of 
        - transition entropy
        - rotational entropy
        - internal entropy
    + each molecule has three degrees of transitional and rotational freedom.
    + two reactants have 12 degrees of transitional and rotational freedom in addition. when they combine, there is a loss of 6 degrees of transitional and rotational freedom.
    + the loss is happened in the binding step.
    + the internal entropy can also lose during the formation of the ES complex.

- destabilization of the ES complex
    + destabilization of the ES complex can involve **structural strain, desolvation, or electrostatic effect**. 
    + destabilization by strain or distortion is usually just a consequence of the fact that the enzyme is designed to bind the transition state more strongly than the substrate.
    + destabilization may involve **desolvation** of charged groups on the substrate upon binding in the active site. charged groups are highly stabilized in water.
    + when a substrate enters she active site charged groups may be forced to interact(unfavorably) with charges of like sign, resulting in electrostatic destabilization. the reaction pathway acts in part to remove this stress. if the charge on the substrate is timinished or lost in the course of reaction, electrostatic destabilization can result in rate acceleration.

- principles of catalysis
    + approximation of reactants
        + the enzymes brings the reactants together at the active site at highly concentration than would be found in solution. this also called **propinquity effect**
    + covalent catalysis
        + a covalent intermediate involving the substrate and the enzyme if formed.
        + **nucleophilic** and **electrophilic** catalysis are two examples of this mechanisms
        + nucleophilic catalysis: the most common nucleophiles in enzymes are serine hydroxyl, cysteine thiol, the carboxylic groups of aspartic acid, the amino group of lysine, tyrosine hydroxyl, and imidazole in histidine.
        + elextrophilic catalysis: the most typical electrophiles is H and \epsilon-amino group of lysine residue. the latter form Schiff base intermediate with the carbonyl group of substrate.
    + general acid or base catalysis
        + amino acids residues in the enzyme function as general acid or base catalysts in reaction
        + the main groups acting as general acid or base catalysts in enzymes ase amino, carboxyl, thiol, phenolic hydroxyl and imidazole group.
        + the most widely existed one in enzymes is the imidazole group of histidine residue.
        + the most important factors affect the reaction rate catalyzed by general acid or base are: acid or base strength, the rate by which the general acid or base donate or accept proton
    + other mechanisms
        + metal ions catalysis: catalysis involving metal ions.
    + sevaral mechanisms working together

### 1.5 Enzyme Inhibition

- the binding position of inhibitors
    + active site of enzyme
    + other portion of enzyme
- the property of inhibition
    + reversible inhibition
        + the activity can be recovered by removing the inhibitors from the enzyme
    + irreversible inhibition
        + the activity can not be recovered by dilution or removal of the inhibitors, due to the covalent bonds formed or the destroyed active site.

#### 1.5.1 competitive inhibition

- competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate for the active site of enzyme.
- they often closely resemble the substrate, but lack the appropriate reactive group or are held at the active site in a manner that prevents the enzyme reaction from occurring.

**deviriation see Guan's ppts**

$$v = k_2 [ES] = \frac{K_2 [E_0][S]}{K_M (1 + \frac{[I]}{K_I}) + [S] }$$ 


#### 1.5.2 Uncompetitive inhibition 反竞争性抑制

$$v = \frac{ \frac{v_{max}}{(1 + [I]/K_I)}[S] }{\frac{K_M}{(1 + [I]/K_I)} + [S]}$$ 

#### 1.5.3 Noncompetitive inhibition 非竞争性抑制

$$v = \frac{ \frac{v_{max}}{(1 + [I]/K_I)} [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$ 

#### 1.5.4 mixed inhibition

in the scheme of non-competitive inhibition, if $K_S \ne K_S^'$, both v_max and K_M will then be altered by the inhibitor concentration. 

#### 1.5.5 substrate inhibition

in some instances, substrate may bind to an alternative site to the active site, and the resulting enzyme-substrate complex may be unreactive. This non-productive binding results in substrate inhibition.

the substrate inhibition can be regarded as a special form of uncompetitive inhibition, where she substrate itself acts as the inhibitor.

$$v = k_2 [ES] = \frac{K_2 [E_0][S]}{K_M (1 + \frac{[S]}{K_I}) + [S] }$$ 

#### 1.5.6 product inhibition

- I_p is structurally similar to S
- I_p binds to free E at active site where S binds
- I_p competes with S for free E
- at low S, resembles competitive inhibition
- however, at high S, the inhibition is not overcome vecause hegher levels of P are generated which inhibit the enzyme.

### 1.6 pre-steady state kinetics

- the rapid-equilibrium assumption (michaelis-menten equation) and quasi-steady-state assumption (briggs-haldane equation) for single substrate reaction lead to the same expression. to tedermine the real mechanisms, we would examine the time course for the formation of [ES] itself.
- due to the large turnover numbers for enzymes, rapid methods to measure the concentration of substrate and product must be employed.
